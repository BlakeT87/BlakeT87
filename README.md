After 15 years in automotive manufacturing, I'm ready to take my problem solving skills and apply them to the tech industry.

Since I was in high school I've been fascinated by computers and I've never stopped.

In my junior year of high school (left, est. 2003) I was part of the school's SWAT (students working to advance technolorgy) program. We learned about computer hardware, and a little bit about computer software.

Since then, I've spent my time raising a family and working my way through the ranks at my company.

After many years, I've decided it's time to make a change. I have so many things I want to learn and explore, and I'm *just* getting started. 

I look forward to building a career in tech and helping the company I work for find efficient solutions to everyday problems.
